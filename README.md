# MemeCreatorProject
A recent project developed in Android studio to demonstrate basic functions of a meme creator. The application allows users to select images from a preinstalled list of photos, from their device camera, or from their storage. After saving the completed meme, users can see all of their created memes in a recyclerview. The application uses a swipe view pager with fragments to toggle between the main screen where the user selects an image to meme-ify or to see memes they have created. The user can create two lines of text on their photo, adjust the font size of each text view individually, adjust the font color of each text view individually, alter the font for each text view from five or six font choices. The application allows users to view completed memes and the finished memes are saved in a publicly accessible folder so that they can be easily viewed from the default gallery app on the device.
